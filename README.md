# Weather-Dashboard

A weather forecast dashboard created using third party API requests and parsing JSON data.

## Challenges
Create a Weather Dashboard while working on my first group project and balancing both assignments.

## Successes

* Getting practice using third party APIs and understanding more about parsind data.

* Keep organized while handling multiple projects at a time

* Getting more practice using CSS frameworks, in this case Boostrap
